# Data for this project
### Finding data
I used kaggle to source my dataset for this project. I knew I wanted to do somehting over sports and initially wanted to do baseball. However after searching for datasets I found the data set [Current NBA Players Contracts History](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarosawjaworski/current-nba-players-contracts-history). I knew getting this data from kaggle could lead to some issues but this was one of the better ones I found in terms of datasets on sports. I also liked this data set because it had only current NBA players so I knew there would not be any cleaning I would have to do when it came to cutting out certain years and players because 10 years ago a large contract might have been $10 million a year while now I large contract is $20 plus million a year.
