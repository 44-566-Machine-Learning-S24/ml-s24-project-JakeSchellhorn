# Data for this project
### Finding data
I used kaggle to source my dataset for this project. I knew I wanted to do somehting over sports and initially wanted to do baseball.
However after searching for datasets I found a data set [Current NBA Players Contracts History](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarosawjaworski/current-nba-players-contracts-history).
