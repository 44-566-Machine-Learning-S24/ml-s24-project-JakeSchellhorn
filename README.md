# 44-566 machine-learning project
Repo for all project documents

## Changed my project from predicting MLB games to predicting NBA players salaries based on their stats
### Completed an initial look at the data and found that we can see correlation with points, assists, and rebounds
I then created new features based on these so I didn't have to deal with large totals of these I created per game stats. It increasses the data's readability and easier to understand. 

### Started to do linear regression and predictions
Based on simple predictions we can get almost 70% of the predicted value determined by the input. This is very promising for the future of the project and making actual predictions in the future.

### Classifying data using decision tree and SVM
First I had to classify my Y category which is salary in my case. I chose to categorize it by low medium and high salaries. I saw overfitting when using the decision tree so that was not very useful but when using the SVM I found the accuracy of my model sitting at around 75%. This is promising to the future of my project but if I were to do this again I would probably add more categories even though it might lower my accuracy.
