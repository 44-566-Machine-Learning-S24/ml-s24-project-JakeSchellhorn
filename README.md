# Predicting NBA Players Salaries 
### An introductory project in Machine Learning

#### Overview
In this project I try to use a dataset I found online and apply different Machine Learning algorithms to it to see if I can have any success and learn more about data analysis as well as machine learning techniques. My project tries to accomplish predicting NBA players salaries categorically. Once I found the dataset I chose to usse I did some initial explorations and analysis to see if the data was useful. I found my input features and narrowed in on what I wanted to predict and my project was ready for more in depth analysis. I first started wtih linear regression which lead me straight into decision trees and svm models. Decent success was found here and when I finally tried unsupervised models such as random forest I knew my project had not quite panned out the way I was hoping for it to. Overall, the project itself may not have been successful but I learned alot and you can find more on each subject in their respective links below. Enjoy exploring my Machine Learning Project!
