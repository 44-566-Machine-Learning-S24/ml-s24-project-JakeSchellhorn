# 44-566 machine-learning project
Repo for all project documents

## Changed my project from predicting MLB games to predicting NBA players salaries based on their stats
### Completed an initial look at the data and found that we can see correlation with points, assists, and rebounds
I then created new features based on these so I didn't have to deal with large totals of these I created per game stats. It increasses the data's readability and easier to understand. 

### Started to do linear regression and predictions
Based on simple predictions we can get above 50% values 

Tasks:

Part A:  Create a notebook called initial_exploration 

Python: Pull in a data set and look at it.
Markdown:  Did you discover interesting relations?
Markdown:  What feature/s would you like to be able to predict?
Python: Clean the data
Python: Create training/test sets

Part B: Create a notebook called linear_regression

Python: Initial data prep section.  Read, clean and create sets.
Markdown: Pick an initial set of features for X and the target feature y.  Explain why you made this choice.
Python: Do a linear regression on X and y.  Compute metrics.
Markdown: Comment on the results.
Python: See if you can do better.
Python: Do a final evaluation with the test set.
Markdown: Look at the parameters you found and discuss what you have learned.
Part C: Update the README to give an overview of the state of your project.  Comment on each of the notebooks and any important results.
