# Conclusions
Overall, my project had some promising milestones but overall did not end up being predictable based on points per game, assists per game and rebounds per game. In my efforts I used multiple models that overall did not perform very well when cross validated. I learned that
on court factors play a role in NBA players salaries, but stats don’t give us everything. One example of this is awards at the end of the season. If a player’s contract year is right after they win defensive player of the year, then they will be more likely to get a pay 
increase because of it. A player's worth may also come down to a teams needs. Rebounds was the least weighted feature in my data yet if a team needs a good rebounder than they may skew a players worth because of their team needs. I believe not being able to consider 
valuable factors stated above limited the predictability of my models.
